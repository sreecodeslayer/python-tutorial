# Why I love Python

- General purpose | 
- Interactive |
- HIGH Level |
- Simple learning curve | 
- Easy maintainence |
- Scalable and Portable |
- Readability | 
- Extensive open-source community |
- Major Scientific/AI/Machine learning/Data related application | 

---

# What you will need to learn

- Desire |
- Text editor |
- Basic bash commands |

---

# What we will learn in two days

+++

## Almost everything:  
- Includes: |
	- Syntax | 
	- Variable Types | 
	- Conditions/Decisions | 
	- Loops | 
	- Datastructures | 
		- List | 
		- Set | 
		- Dictionaries | 
		- Tuples |
	- Functions
	- Module and importing |
	- Classes and Objects (Basics) |
	- Files and I/O |

# Where to run the code?

+++

## There are two simple ways:
- Interactive Mode Programming (Python Shell) |  
- Script Mode Programming (Python Code Files) |  

---

# Syntax [The Rules]

+++

# Identifiers and Reserved Words

+++

## Identifiers:
- identify a variable, function, class, module or other object |  
- follows some naming conventions |  

+++

## Reserved Words:

- and
- exec
- not
- assert
- finally
- or
- break
- for
- pass
- class

## Comments and Documentation:

+++

Single line comments

```python
# This is a python single line comment, usually used to give short description of the code below or above
```

+++

## Multiline Comments/Description :

+++

Multiline comments

```python
'''
This is a multiline comment.
This is intended mainly for longer description of modules, documentation strings, class, object entity desciprion.
You can add as many lines as you want.
Python interpreter doesn't care to read this part.
'''
```

# Variable Types

+++

## Variables:
- reserved memory locations to store values |
- the amount of memory allocated depends on the variable type |

+++

## Types:
- Numbers |
- Strings |
- List |
- Tuple |
- Dictionaries |

+++

## Numbers:

```python
number1 = 1
number2 = 2.5

print "Number 1: ", number1
print "Number 2: ", number2

del number1
```
@[1](Define an integer, type: INT)
@[2](Define a floating point real value, type : FLOAT)

@[4](Print out the value of number1)
@[5](Print out the value of number2)

@[6](Delete the variable and release allocated memory for the variable: number1)
